1. Download the heimdall Theme ZIP file from ThemeForest.

2. Inside the ZIP file you will find 4 folders: `license`, `docs`, `heimdall`, `media` and 1 ZIP file called `heimdall.zip`. Extract the whole folder that contains the previously mentioned files.

3. Navigate to the **Integrations** section on your Ghost Admin Dashboard.

4. Click on **Custom Integration** and write a name like "Search".

5. Copy the Content API Key and the API URL.

6. With your favorite code editor open the `default.hbs` file located at ` heimdall/` directory.

7. On line **49**, **50** paste your API Key and API URL on the correspondant place. For example:

```html title=heimdall/default.hbs highlight={14,15}
<body class="{{body_class}}">

    {{> navbar }}
    {{> search-panel }}

    <main class="z-20 bg-white-1 dark:bg-black-1 transition-all space-y-16 lg:space-y-36">
        {{{body}}}
        {{> footer}}
    </main>

    {{{block "index-scripts"}}}
    {{{block "post-scripts"}}}
    <script>
        var SEARCH_API_KEY = "**YOUR API KEY HERE**";
        var SEARCH_API_URL = "**YOUR API URL HERE**";
    </script>
    <script src="{{asset "built/js/search.js"}}"></script>
    <script src="{{asset "built/js/main.js"}}"></script>

    {{ghost_foot}}

</body>
```

8. Save the document. ZIP the theme.

9. Navigate to the administration panel of your Ghost Blog. Then, go to the **Settings** section, located at the sidebar and click on **Design**. Click on **Change Theme** and click on the green button that says: **Upload Theme**.

10. A dialog asking for a ZIP file will prompt. Select the `heimdall.zip` you created in step **8**.

11. Now, you'll need to upload the `routes.yaml` file to your Ghost Dashboard in order to display Sign Up, Sign In and Profile page. To do so, head over to your **Settings Panel** and click on **Labs**.

12. On the bottom side of the screen click a button that says **Upload routes YAML**, select the `routes.yaml` file that's located at the root of your Heimdall directory.

13. That's it. You are ready to go with your new blog.
