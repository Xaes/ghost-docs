## Set Dual logos

Heimdall supports logos. The recommended size is: **560 x 110px**. You may need two different color version of your logo. Because Heimdall has 2 main colors (dark / light), your logo might not be visible in one of them (Ex.: If your logo is white and you have set the light version of the theme, it would be impossible to see your logo, since the main navbar and your logo are the same color). The theme can handle two logos at a time and switch them accordly.

To use the logo switcher, follow these steps:

- Copy your two PNG logo files on your `heimdall/assets/images` directory.

- Make sure to rename the dark version of your logo to `logo-dark.png` and the light one to `logo-light.png`.

- Open the `logo.hbs` file located at the `heimdall/partials/` directory.

- Delete the entire line **2** and **5** of the doc. Then, comment the line **6**:

```html title=heimdall/partials/logo.hbs highlight={2,5}
<a href="{{@site.url}}" class="h-full mr-8">
    <!-- 
        <img alt="{{@site.title}}" src="{{asset "images/logo-black.png"}}" class="h-full logo-black mx-auto lg:mx-0" style="max-height: 100%; width: auto; max-width: 200px;" />
        <img alt="{{@site.title}}" src="{{asset "images/logo-white.png"}}" class="h-full logo-white mx-auto lg:mx-0" style="max-height: 100%; width: auto; max-width: 200px;" />
     -->
    <img alt="{{@site.title}}" class="mx-auto lg:mx-0" src="{{@site.logo}}" style="max-height: 100%; width: auto; max-width: 200px;" />
</a>
```

- Save the file. This is how your code should look like after the proper changes:

```html title=heimdall/partials/logo.hbs
<a href="{{@site.url}}" class="h-full mr-8">
    <img alt="{{@site.title}}" src="{{asset "images/logo-black.png"}}" class="h-full logo-black mx-auto lg:mx-0" style="max-height: 100%; width: auto; max-width: 200px;" />
    <img alt="{{@site.title}}" src="{{asset "images/logo-white.png"}}" class="h-full logo-white mx-auto lg:mx-0" style="max-height: 100%; width: auto; max-width: 200px;" />
    <!-- <img alt="{{@site.title}}" class="mx-auto lg:mx-0" src="{{@site.logo}}" style="max-height: 100%; width: auto; max-width: 200px;" /> -->
</a>
```

- In order to activate the logo support, go to your Ghost Admin Dashboard and upload **any** version of your logo (Heimdall only needs to detect whether if you want to use a logo or not. So, it doesn't matters which one you upload from the dashboard, the theme will still use those images you copied and renamed on step **1** and **2**).

- Rezip the theme, and upload it again to your blog.

## Add Disqus

- In the administration panel of your Disqus's site, click on **Edit Settings**.

- Look up for the Disqus shortname and copy it. **Note:** The shortname won't be the same as shown in the screenshot.

- Open the `post.hbs` file located at your `heimdall/` directory. Paste the your Disqus site name in line **63** between the double quotes of `shortname`.

```html title=Heimdall/partials/content-cta.hbs highlight={18}
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 xl:gap-12 mt-16">
    {{#next_post}}
        <div class="col-span-2 md:col-span-1 xl:col-span-1 md:order-3 xl:order-1">
            <div class="h-72 sm:h-96 xl:h-80">
                {{> "post-card" next="true"}}
            </div>
        </div>
    {{/next_post}}
    {{#prev_post}}
        <div class="col-span-2 md:col-span-1 xl:col-span-1">
            <div class="h-72 sm:h-96 xl:h-80">
                {{> "post-card" prev="true"}}
            </div>
        </div>
    {{/prev_post}}
</div>
{{! Comments (Disqus) - Go to partials/comments.hbs to view this partial. Remove the "!" to activate this partial}}
{{> "comments" shortname="" }}
```

- Rezip the theme, and upload it again to your blog.
