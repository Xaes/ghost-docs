## Set Dual logos

Valkyrie supports logos. The recommended size is: **560 x 110px**. You may need two different color version of your logo. Because Valkyrie has 2 main colors (dark / light), your logo might not be visible in one of them (Ex.: If your logo is white and you have set the light version of the theme, it would be impossible to see your logo, since the main navbar and your logo are the same color). The theme can handle two logos at a time and switch them accordly.

To use the logo switcher, follow these steps:

- Copy your two PNG logo files on your `valkyrie/assets/images` directory.

- Make sure to rename the dark version of your logo to `logo-dark.png` and the light one to `logo-light.png`.

- Open the `navigation.hbs` file located at the `valkyrie/partials/` directory.

- Delete the entire line **7** and **10** of the doc. Then, comment the line **12**:

```html title=valkyrie/partials/navbar.hbs highlight={2,5,7}
<a class="navbar-brand" href="{{@site.url}}">
  <!-- DUAL LOGO SWITCHER
    <img alt="{{@site.title}}" class="img-fluid lazy logo-dark" src="{{asset "images/logo-dark.png"}}" />
    <img alt="{{@site.title}}" class="img-fluid lazy logo-light" src="{{asset "images/logo-light.png"}}" />
    -->
  <!-- SINGLE LOGO -->
  <img alt="{{@site.title}}" class="img-fluid lazy" src="{{@site.logo}}" />
</a>
```

- Save the file. This is how your code should look like after the proper changes:

```html title=valkyrie/partials/navbar.hbs
<a class="navbar-brand" href="{{@site.url}}">
  <img alt="{{@site.title}}" class="img-fluid lazy logo-dark" src="{{asset
  "images/logo-dark.png"}}" /> <img alt="{{@site.title}}" class="img-fluid lazy
  logo-light" src="{{asset "images/logo-light.png"}}" />
  <!-- SINGLE LOGO 
        <img alt="{{@site.title}}" class="img-fluid lazy" src="{{@site.logo}}" />
    -->
</a>
```

- In order to activate the logo support, go to your Ghost Admin Dashboard and upload **any** version of your logo (Valkyrie only needs to detect whether if you want to use a logo or not. So, it doesn't matters which one you upload from the dashboard, the theme will still use those images you copied and renamed on step **1** and **2**).

- Rezip the theme, and upload it again to your blog.

## Add Disqus

If you want to display comments on your posts. Valkyrie has a Disqus partial ready to be activated.

- Login into your Disqus account. Navigate to your Disqus's Admin Panel and create a site if you don't have any.

- Select your existant Disqus site, and click on **Installing Disqus**.

- In the administration panel of your Disqus's site, click on **Edit Settings**.

- Look up for the Disqus shortname and copy it. **Note:** The shortname won't be the same as shown in the screenshot.

- Open the `content-cta.hbs` file located at your `valkyrie/partials` directory. Paste the your Disqus site name in line 12 between the double quotes of `shortname`.

```html title=valkyrie/partials/content-cta.hbs highlight={12}
<article>{{{content}}}</article>

{{! Article Bottom - Go to partials/article-bottom.hbs to view this partial. }}
{{> "article-bottom"}} {{! Next / Prev Post - Go to partials/nextprev.hbs to
view this partial. }} {{> "nextprev"}} {{! Disqus - Go to partials/disqus.hbs to
view this partial. Remove the "!" to activate this partial}} {{> "disqus"
shortname=""}}
```

- Rezip the theme, and upload it again to your blog.

## Enable Color Switcher

Valkyrie has a color selector disabled by default. To activate it, follow these steps:

- Open the `default.hbs` file located at your `valkyrie/` directory.

- Go to line **45**. Inside the double quotes of `switcher` attribute put `true`.

```html title=valkyrie/default.hbs highlight={3}
<body>
    {{! Navbar - Go to partials/navbar.hbs to view this partial. }}
    {{> navbar switcher=""}}

    {{{body}}}

    {{! Search - Go to partials/search.hbs to view this partial. }}
    {{> "search"}}

    {{! Footer - Go to partials/footer.hbs to view this partial. }}
    {{> "footer"}}

    {{! JS ASSETS }}

    <script>
        var ghosthunter_key = "";
        var maxPages = parseInt('{{pagination.pages}}');
        var endMessage = '{{t "No More Posts"}}';
        var loadingMessage = '{{t "Loading..."}}';
        var Message = '{{t "More posts"}}';
    </script>

    <script src="{{asset "built/js/extra.js"}}"></script>
    {{{block "post-scripts"}}}
    <script src="{{asset "built/js/main.js"}}"></script>

    {{ghost_foot}}
</body>
```

## Change default colors

This only will take effect if you have the Color Selector featured disabled in Valkyrie. There are 4 accent colors available and ready to use: green, blue, purple and red. Also, 2 base colors: dark and light. To change them, follow those steps:

- Open the `theme-colors.hbs` file located at your `valkyrie/partials/` directory.

- Replace the color of line **2** by any other available (green, blue, purple and orange / dark and light). For example:

```html title=valkyrie/partials/theme-colors.hbs highlight={2}
{{! You can also use: brown, green, purple, red. And: dark, light. }} brown dark
```

- Rezip the theme, and upload it again to your blog.

## Code Highlighting

If you are a developer and want to display your code in a nice way, Valkyrie comes with a code highlighter called Prism. It supports +150 languages (with +60 installed on the theme). To activate it, create a new HTML widget on your post and write these 2 lines of code:

```html
<pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-xxxx">{your code}</code>
</pre>
```

Prism needs to know which languague you want to highlight. As last step you need to specify it as a class value on the code tag. In this case the `x`'s on `language-xxxx` need to be replaced by the language name. For example, if you want to highlight **CSS** code, the class value would be: `language-css`. After that, write your code inside the code tag. For more information and know about supported languages lookup the Prism documentation [here](https://prismjs.com/). Valkyrie has also installed the line enumeration plugin, you can activate it by adding the `line-numbers` class on the pre tag.

## Translations

Valkyrie already brings 2 languages by default: **English** and **Spanish**. If you want to switch between those two, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Ghost Admin Panel.

2. Navigate to "General" in "Settings" section at the sidebar. Expand the **Publication Language** tab and write `en` for English and `es` for Spanish.

#### If you want to add another language, follow these steps:

1. Create a JSON file in your `valkyrie/locales/` directory with the name of the language you want to use following the [HTML ISO Language Code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp). (e.g.: es for Spanish, fr for French, zh for Chinese, ja for Japanese).

2. Open the en.json file, copy the code and then, paste it on the new file you just created at step 1.

3. On each line, replace the value after the colon with your translation, between the double quotes. Save the file.

4. Go to your Ghost Admin Panel.

5. Navigate to **General** in **Settings** section at the sidebar. Expand the **Publication Language** tab and write the name of the file you just wrote (HTML ISO Lang. Code).
