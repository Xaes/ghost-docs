1. Download the Athena Theme ZIP file from ThemeForest.

2. Inside the ZIP file you will find 4 folders: `license`, `docs`, `athena`, and 1 ZIP file called `athena.zip`. Extract the whole folder that contains the previously mentioned files.

3. Navigate to the **Integrations** section on your Ghost Admin Dashboard.

4. Click on **Custom Integration** and write a name like "Search".

5. Copy the Content API key.

6. With your favorite code editor open the default.hbs file located at ` athena/` directory.

7. Go to line **51**. Copy your API key between the double quotes. For example:

```html title=athena/default.hbs highlight={2}
<script>
  var ghosthunter_key = "**Your key here**";
  var maxPages = parseInt("{{pagination.pages}}");
  var endMessage = '{{t "No more posts"}}';
</script>
```

8. Save the document. ZIP the theme.

9. Navigate to the administration panel of your Ghost Blog. Then, go to the **Settings** section, located at the sidebar and click on **Design**. Scroll down to **Themes** section and click on the green button that says: **Upload a Theme**.

10. A dialog asking for a ZIP file will prompt. Select the `athena.zip` you extracted in step 1. That's it. You are ready to go with your new blog.
