## Error: File Missing "style.css".

This means that you have made a wrong purchase since you are installing this theme on a WordPress site. Our themes are only compatible with Ghost. Ghost and WordPress are completely different CMS platforms. You can't also ask for a refund, since the [Themeforest Refund Policy](https://themeforest.net/page/customer_refund_policy) clearly states that there are not refunds made for mistaken purchases.

## Do you have any plans to make a WordPress version?

No. None of my themes will be available for WordPress or any other platform.

## The search form freezes with a loading icon.

This happens because you need to use a Custom Integration so the search functionality has access to the Ghost Content API. If you miscongured or didn't configured the integration at all, a loading icon will be displayed infinitely. Please, refer to the installation steps of the theme you bought inside this documentation to know how to properly configure your Search Functionality.

## I am not seeing the carousel on my main page, instead there is a big empty space.

You have to at least mark a post as **Featured**. To do so, head over to any post on your Ghost Dashboard. Click on the Settings, it will open the configuration sidebar, scroll all the way down until you find a check that says **Feature This Post**, then, update your post. The carousel should be displayed correctly.

## Can you add / modify such feature / section?

No. I won't provide any customization or additions to any of my themes. However, I will be making regular updates and fixes so my themes are up-to-date with the Ghost platform. If you want to make any addition to the theme, I would recommend hiring a freelancer to do so.
